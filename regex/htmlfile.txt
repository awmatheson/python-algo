<b>Programming Assignment 6:</b><br>
<b>HTML Checker</b><br>
<b>Due Date: Oct. 23, 11:59 pm</b><br>

<p>A <i>markup language</i> is a system for inserting annotations into a
   document.  The most important feature of a markup language is that
   the <i>tags</i> it uses to indicate annotations should be easy to
   distinguish from the document <i>content</i>.</p>

<p>One of the most well-known markup languages is the one commonly used
   to create Web pages, called <b>HTML</b>, or "Hypertext Markup Language".
   In HTML, tags appear in "angle brackets" such as in "&lt;html&gt;".
   When you load a Web page in your browser, you don't see the tags
   themselves:  the browser interprets the tags as instructions on
   how to format the text for display.</p>

<p>Most tags in HTML are used in pairs to indicate where an effect
   starts and ends.  For example:</p>
<ul>
   <li>&lt;p&gt; represents the start of a paragraph, and &lt;/p&gt;
       indicates where that paragraph ends.</li>
   <li>&lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt; are used to place the enclosed text
       in <b>bold</b> font, and &lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt; indicate
       that the enclosed text is <i>italic</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that "end" tags look just like the "start" tags, except for
   the addition of a backslash after the &lt; symbol.</p>

<p>Sets of tags are often nested inside other sets of tags.  For
   example, an <i>ordered list</i> is a list of numbered bullets.
   You specify the start of an ordered list with the tag &lt;ol&gt;,
   and the end with &lt;/ol&gt;.  Within the ordered list, you
   identify items to be numbered with the tags &lt;li&gt; (for "list
   item") and &lt;/li&gt;.  For example, the following specification:</p>
<pre>
   &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;First item&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Second item&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Third item&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ol&gt;
</pre>

<p>would result in the following:</p>

<ol>
   <li>First item</li>
   <li>Second item</li>
   <li>Third item</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice how you start the ordered list with the &lt;ol&gt; tag, 
   specify three line items with matching &lt;li&gt; and &lt;/li&gt;
   tags, and the close the ordered list with the &lt;/ol&gt; tag.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that the pattern of using matching tags
   strongly resembles the pattern of matching parentheses that we
   discussed in class:  when you use parentheses, brackets, and
   braces, they have to match in reverse order, such as "{[()]}".
   A pattern such as "[(])" would be incorrect since the right
   bracket does not match the left parenthesis.  Similarly, an
   HTML pattern such as &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   would be incorrect since the closing tags are in the wrong
   order.</p>

<p><b>Your assignment</b> is to write an "HTML Checker" program that
   takes as input an HTML file, and produces a report indicating whether
   or not the tags are correctly matched.</p>

<ul>
   <li>Just as the parenthesis checker uses a stack to store symbols
       waiting for a match to be found, your program should also use
       a stack. <b>You should include the list implementation of the
       Stack abstract data type in your code.</b></li>
   <li>The first task your program must do is read in an HTML file and
       extract the tags.  A simple strategy for doing this would be to
       write a function "getTag" that:</li>
       <ul>
          <li>reads one character at a time from the data file, throwing
              everything away until it gets to a "&lt;".  (Discard the
              "&lt;" as well.)</li>
          <li>reads one character at a time, appending it to a string,
              until it gets to a "&gt;" or a space.  (Discard the "&gt;"
              as well.)</li>
          <li>returns the string as a tag.</li>
       </ul>
   <li>Call getTag repeatedly, saving the results in a list.  Make sure
       you account for end-of-file conditions in getTag.  If you've done
       everything correctly, you now have a list of tags, both start and
       end.</li> 
   <li>Iterating through your list of tags:</li>
       <ul>
          <li>if a tag does not start with a "/", it's a start tag.
              Push it on a stack.</li>
          <li>if a tag starts with a "/", and the rest of it matches
              the tag on the stack, it's a correctly matched end tag.
              Pop the start tag off the stack.</li>
          <li>if a tag starts with a "/" but does not match the tag
              on the top of the stack, there is a mismatch.  Print
              an error message and terminate.</li>
       </ul>
</ul>

<p><b>Input:</b></p>

<p>As input for your program, use this file!  That is, use the file
   "http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bulko/fall2015/50597.hw6.html".  Download
   this file to your computer and rename it "htmlfile.txt".</p>

<p><b>Output:</b></p>

<p>The output of your program should include the following:</p>
   <li>A printout of your list of tags (the result of your repeated calls
       to getTag).</li>
   <li>One line for each tag as you process it, explaining the action
       and showing the current contents of the stack.  Some <u>examples
       </u> are:</li> 
<pre>
      Tag is b : pushed:  stack is now [html, body, b]
      Tag is /b : matches:  stack is now [html, body]
      Tag is ul : pushed:  stack is now [html, body, ul]
</pre>

<p>Your program should end with either:</p>
<pre>
      Error:  tag is XXX but top of stack is YYY
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
      Processing complete.  No mismatches found.
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
      Processing complete.  Unmatched tags remain on stack:  [XXX, YYY, ZZZ]
</pre>

<p><b>Plot Twist:</b>

<p>There are some tags that do not need matching start and end tags!
   One example is &lt;br /&gt;.  This tag is used to indicate a line
   break at the current location.  Another is &lt;meta&gt;, which is
   used to provide special information ("metadata") about a Web page.</p>

<p>Keep a list of these special cases in a list called EXCEPTIONS which
   you hard-code into your main program.  They will appear in your
   list of tags just as any other tags.  However, when you begin your
   iteration through the list and you encounter one of these, you do
   not need to push it on the stack since you won't be waiting for a
   close tag.  Instead, just print an output line such as:</p>
<pre>
      Tag is br : does not need to match:  stack is now [html, body, b]
</pre>
<p>and continue.</p>

<p><b>General requirements:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>You must submit a file called htmlChecker.py via Canvas by the deadline
    shown at the top of this page.</li>
<li>As always, I will be looking for good documentation, descriptive variable
    names, clean logical structure, and adherence to all coding conventions
    expected of an experienced programmer; there will be penalties for failure
    to meet these standards.</li>
<li>Your code must compile and run before submission. </li>
<li>Don't forget to include the header (as described in previous assignments)! </li>
</ul>
